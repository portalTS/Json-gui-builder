# JSon-gui-builder

Json-GUI-Builder is a graphical tool to build JSON object; through a simple interface, the Builder enables of the definition of objects that are composed of a set of parameters and related validation, constraint and condition rules to define parameter behaviour, to dynamically verify parameter correctness, to force specific conditions among parameters. 

The tool has been mainly developed to support <a href="https://github.com/portalTS/json-gui" rel="nofollow">Json-GUI</a>, an AngularJS front-end module that dynamically generates a full-featured form-based web interface, including validation and constraints, starting from a formal JSON configuration object. Since the definition of the input for the generation of the web form could become a bit challenging, we developed the Builder to support developers.

Json-GUI-Builder and Json-GUI are provided as separated tools since they could be also used autonomously, i.e. to define and to render any type of JSON object – not necessary in conjunction, and no dependencies are actually implemented among the two tools. However, Json-GUI without the Builder comes less interesting and the combination of the two tools represents an added value for both.

The present version of Json-GUI-Builder is in update phase to allow the complete support to the further features implemented in the last release of Json-GUI.
